# Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to the implementation and exploration of various Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) algorithms. The goal is to create a comprehensive collection of Deep RL methods that can serve as a learning resource and a starting point for further research and development. This project aims to provide clean, understandable, and educational implementations of deep RL algorithms without relying on third-party baselines.
## Project Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress: This repository is actively being updated. New algorithms and updates will be added as they are implemented or refined. Some Deep RL algorithms are fully implemented and are being polished for publication. Others are in various stages of development, with plans to complete and refine them in the near future.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC):
    + Continuous action-space:
        * Vanilla Experience Replay
        * Prioritized Experience Replay
- Proximal Policy Optimization
     + Discrete Action-space
          * Vanilla
- More algorithms will be added.
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
